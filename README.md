# PublicLibrary
<b>Operationalizing publicly available reports and intel to craft emulation plans for defenders. </b>
- Many of the plans can be used by teams of all sizes. We especially want to provide support for service providers such as MSP's. SMBs / SMEs / and Micro Businesses need more advanced defenses. They also need guidance. We hope this public library will empower them. Plans that use [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team "Atomic Red   Team Github") are especially useful, everything you need is free/open-source. 
- Enterprises and mature security teams can greatly benefit from these plans as well.
Mitre ATT&CK is utilized and our plans map to the framework.

A great defense is understanding the offense. <br>
This project was created to provide a public service to assist the global community. 
<br>If you need a lab, check out [Chris Long's Detection Lab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab "Detection Lab"). </br>
Please reach out with any questions, suggestions, or corrections.
We look forward to creating with/for you.

<h5> Disclaimer: These plans are not indented to provide any type of guarantees in preventing attacks. By following this plan, the authors are not responsible for any type of damage that may occur with execution. Anyone attempting to use this plan should do so in a non-production/ isolated environment. Technologists executing this plan should have a sound understanding of what is going on within each test. If this is your first time using Atomic Red Team, we recommend you practice in a lab environment. We always recommend practicing new TTPâ€™s in a dedicated lab, until you have a full understanding of the test.  This work is open to the public, as are all the sources. If there is a source we forgot to add, please let us know, and we will happily give credit. If you see an error in our plan, please contact us. Our public library is an attempt to provide resources, knowledge, and defensive strategies for the businesses that keep society functioning. All businesses, of any size, in any location of the globe should advance their security defenses. If you are interesting in working with us, contact us @aptemulation. </h5>
