### Operationalize Red Canary's 2022 Threat Report. 
<br>The report is incredibly detailed and well executed. Our goal here is to inform defenders on additional strategies for using it. 
<br>This entry covers the top techniques/sub-techniques used. 
<br> [The Report](https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/)

The Report provides atomic  test examples you can easily run. This plan goes deeper into those techniques with 30 tests.  
<br>For sub-techniques with multiple tests, the external resources are not necessarily test specific, though some are, they are to help you have a deeper understanding of the technique. 
<br> https://attack.mitre.org/ has a collection of references at the bottom of each technique/sub -technique.
<br> Most of the tools used are part of regular operations. 
<br> While adversaries use custom/commercial/open-source tooling, many of the ways they can pivot and dig deeper into your network are with tools native to Windows/sysinternals.  
<br> We chose less complex tests to ensure usability, especially for first time ART users. 
<br>While the tests chosen are simpler to execute, they are still valuable for security teams of all levels. 
<br> If a test is recommended in the report, and we also added it to our plan, it is a test we highly recommend. 

If this is your first time emulating or using Atomics, the good people at Scythe put together a very user friendly guide for operationalizing the report. 
It requires a copy and paste, and will provide a real feel for how atomics work.
